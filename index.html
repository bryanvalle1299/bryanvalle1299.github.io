  <br><h1>Biography</h1><br>
    <br>
    Odin is the main god in Norse Mythology. Described as an immensely wise, one-eyed old man, Odin has by far<br>
    the most varied characteristics of any of the gods and is not only the man to call upon when war was being<br>
    prepared but is also the god of poetry, of the dead, of runes, and of magic. Part of the AEsirfamily of the<br>
    gods, he helped create the world, resides in Asgard (the stronghold and home of the gods), and gathers slain<br>
    warriors around him in Valhalla, but is eventually crunched to death by the wolf Fenrir in the Ragnarok, the<br>
    'final destiny of the gods' in which the world is destroyed.<br>

  <br><h2>Odin Battles</h2><br>
    <br>
    In modern popular culture, Odin is often portrayed as being an eminently honorable ruler and battlefield commander<br>
    (not to mention impossibly muscular), but to the ancient Norse, he was nothing of the sort. In contrast to more<br>
    straightforwardly noble war gods such as Tyr or Thor, Odin incites otherwise peaceful people to strife with what, to<br>
    modern tastes, is a downright sinister glee. His attitude is not far from Nietzsche's dictum, (You say it is the<br>
    good cause that hallows even war? I say unto you: it is the good war that hallows any cause.)<br>
